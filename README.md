# React Native App: [Your App Name]

This README provides instructions on how to clone the repository, set up the development environment, and run your React Native application.

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn): Download and install the latest version of Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) which includes npm. Alternatively, you can use a version manager like nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage multiple Node.js versions.
Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone git@github.com:Bansikah/react-native-application.git
Use code with caution.
Replace [your-username] with your GitHub username and [your-repo-name] with the name of your repository.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd [your-repo-name]
Use code with caution.
Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

Bash
npm install  # or yarn install
Use code with caution.
This will install all the necessary libraries and packages for your project to run.

Start the Development Server:

Android:

Bash
npx react-native run-android
Use code with caution.
This will start the Metro Bundler, which compiles your JavaScript code, and launch the app on a connected Android device or emulator.

iOS:

Option 1: Using a Mac:

Ensure you have Xcode installed: Download Xcode from the Mac App Store (https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Connect your iOS device: Connect your iPhone or iPad to your Mac using a USB cable.

Run the development server:

Bash
npx react-native run-ios
Use code with caution.
Option 2: Using an Android Device (Expo CLI Required):

Install the Expo CLI globally:

Bash
npm install -g expo-cli
Use code with caution.
Run the development server:

Bash
expo start
Use code with caution.
Then, follow the instructions on your screen to open the app on your iOS device using the Expo app.

Running the App on a Physical Device
Android:

Ensure your Android device is connected to your development machine via USB with Developer Options enabled (Settings -> About Phone -> Tap build number 7 times -> Enable Developer Options).
Run npx react-native run-android in your terminal.
iOS:

Connect your iOS device to your Mac using a USB cable.
If using Xcode, run npx react-native run-ios in your terminal.
If using Expo CLI, follow the instructions on your screen to open the app on your device using the Expo app.
